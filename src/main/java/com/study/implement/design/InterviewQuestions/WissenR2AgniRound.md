- What is IaaS and Paas? Which one is better for scaling? What is the application of both of them? In what scenario will you use on over the other? 
- Say that you want to design, deploy and make your service agile in the sense of quick and reliable deployments. How will you set up this? What tool will you use? How would you make sure that you are able to do the deployment quickly in whatever environment that you choose? How will you configure and complete this on fly?
- What are the three types of programming? Recursive? Iterative? Functional?
  - Compare it. What's better in Space, Time Complexity. How much do you understand what each type of programming is? Where are they applicable and what is the benefit of one over others. 
  - Use the factorial function and then explore and have a conversation on these types of programming.
  - What's better in a threaded or a multithreaded environment 
- How to make a class immutable in java 21? 
  - If you are not using records then? 
  - Also, if you have a List<Object> in your final class, which is normally a reference object then can you call the calls final? 
  - What makes a class truly final? 
  - What is the significance of reference type and value type here? 
  - What about structs in C/C++? Can you compare how they work and then compare how this would work and will the class be final or not basically immutable?
- Can intermediate operations in stream access a local/outside scoped variable? 
  - How does stream handle intermediate state of objects?
- Say that you want to sort a list of objects/data on the basis of some value. In what condition will you use inline functions and in what condition will you define your own comparator? 
- What are design patterns? what is the requirement? Why learn them? What use are they of off a developer? What are some design patterns you know? What are some design patterns you have implemented? Why was there the requirement to implement that specific design pattern? 
  - What are chain of responsibility design pattern and how is it designed/implemented in java/spring boot?
  - What is middleware design pattern and how is it designed/implemented in java/spring boot?
- What is multithreading? Where will you apply multithreading and in what scenario will you use multithreading? 
  - Where and how will you define the number of threads that are available? 
  - How will you make sure that the amount of threads you are using will give you the necessary performance improvement? 
  - How can you control the amount of threads you are using? What are kernel level threads? 
  - And can you control how kernel threads are made and assigned in Java? 
- What do you know about prototype in python/javascript and how do you compare that to object types in Java?
- Can you make a snake and ladder game? 
  - Show the objects that you would create for this.
